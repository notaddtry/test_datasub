You can try this at => https://test-datasub.vercel.app/

In this case I realized Credit Card app(with MongoDB and reat-input-mask)

You can try to add some more cards,but you must correctly pass inpus.

Then you may press button and all data go to Mongo. You can see response in console

If you try to add this cart more,then one time,you can see log in console with error.

If you want to try it on your locale => 

1)Clone this rep =>

2)Run 'npm init' into your terminal =>

3)Run 'npm run dev' into your terminal

P.S. If you want to try it on locale => add to your main folder '.env.locale' file,where you must enter 'MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://notaddtry:123321@cluster1.kg6ttfh.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

See ya
