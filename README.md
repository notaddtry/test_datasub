You can try this at => https://test-datasub.vercel.app/

In this case I realized Credit Card app(with MongoDB and react-input-mask)

You can try to add some more cards,but you must correctly pass inpus.

Then you can press button and all data will go to Mongo. You will be able to see response in console.

If you try to add one more card with same number, you can see log with error in console.

If you want to try it on your localhost => 

1)Clone this rep =>

2)Run 'npm init' into your terminal =>

3)Run 'npm run dev' into your terminal

P.S. If you want to try it on localhost => add to your main folder '.env.locale' file, where you must enter 'MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://notaddtry:cBhzViyU9BzH5RPj@cluster1.kg6ttfh.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

See ya
